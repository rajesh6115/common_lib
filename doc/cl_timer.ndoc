= DESCRIPTION =

Timer functions.


= UTILITY EXPORTS =

Timer utilities exports.


== tc_avg(Mod, Fun, Args, Times) -> Result ==

: Types
 : Mod = atom()
 : Fun = atom()
 : Args = term()
 : Times = int() > 0
 : Result = {Min, Max, Med, Avg}
 : Min = int()
 : Max = int()
 : Med = int()
 : Avg = int()


Evaluates ``apply(Mod, Fun, Args)``  ``Times`` times and returns the minimun,
maximun, median and average excution times.


== then(TimeLapse) -> {MegaSecs, Secs, MicroSecs} ==

: Types
 : TimeLapse = int()
 : MegaSecs = int()
 : Secs = int()
 : MicroSecs = int()

This function adds ``TimeLapse`` microseconds to the result of the BIF
``erlang:timestamp/0``.


= TIMER EXPORTS =

These functions replace those in the standard **timer** module.


== cancel(Ref) -> Time | false ==

: Types
 : Ref = ref()
 : Time = int()


Cancels a timer, where ``Ref``  was  returned by ``exit_after/2-3``.  If the
timer is there  to be removed, the function returns the time in milliseconds
left until the timer would have  expired, otherwise ``false``.


== exit_after(Time, Reason) -> Ref ==
== exit_after(Time, Pid, Reason) -> Ref ==

: Types
 : 0 <= Time <= 4294967295
 : Pid = pid()
 : Reason = term()
 : Ref = ref()


Sends and exit signal with reason ``Reason`` to ``Pid`` after ``Time``.  Returns
the timer reference that can later be used by ``cancel/1``.  If ``Pid`` is
unspecified ``self()`` is used.
